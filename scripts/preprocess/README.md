# Preprocessing

This directory contains scripts which translate the raw, distributed forms of labeled and unlabeled datasets into a standardized storage format which can be used for modeling. The top-level scripts are either utilities or are to be used after preprocessing is complete. The scripts within `reddit/` and `twitter/` subdirectories should be executed first.
